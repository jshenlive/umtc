# University of Manitoba Tennis Club Website 

- This website is created using React JS as frontend and using Google web app scripts inside of Google Sheets as backend. 
- Using Google Sheets allow non-technical members to manage club databases such as member rosters, club events, and various sign up forms.
- Another reason for this combination of the framework is to take advantage of the free tier options.
- In future development, a switch to entry-level commercial services is recommended.
